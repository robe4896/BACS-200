            To me, inspiration comes from those whose values hit close to our heart. Someone shares the same values as you, but then also acts on those values is someone you should look up to. One of my biggest inspirations is Ellen DeGeneres.

        I could create a never ending list of reasons why I am inspired by Ellen DeGeneres, but to keep it short, here's my top 6!
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>She is unapologetically herself. </li>
            <li>She has the best sense of humour. </li>
            <li>She uses her fame to better the lives of others. </li>
            <li>She leaves a positive impact everywhere she can. </li>
            <li>She is the most generous and giving person. </li>
            <li>She has a heart of gold! </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        In my opinion, no other celebrity makes an impact on the world like Ellen DeGeneres does. She not only donates to meanigful charities, but she directly helps people who are in need. She doesn't only give away money, but she puts a lot of thought into the things that will make someones quality of life better. She doesn't do any of this for herself or her image either, she does it out of the goodness of her heart. Knowing that she does these things just to be genuinely nice, inspires SO many people to do the same thing. I know she makes me and my mom want to be better people and help others, so I'm sure the same is true for plenty of other people.
